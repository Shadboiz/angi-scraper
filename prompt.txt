You will always be given JSON in this format:

```json
{
  "state_code": "xx",
  "state_name": "SomeState",
  "cities": [
    "city-one",
    "city-two",
    "city-three",
    ...
  ]
}
```

**Task:**

1. Label each city by number, starting at 1 in the order it appears in the array.
2. When I ask for the "richest cities" in that state, return **only the TOP 5–10 most affluent cities** in that state, based on widely recognized wealth (household income, real estate value, prestige).
3. Always choose only those cities that are among the wealthiest and most business-viable — where companies have the potential to generate **$100K/month or more per business location**.
4. Output format must be strictly:

   ```
   123, 456, 789
   ```

   (Numbers only, no text, no explanation).
